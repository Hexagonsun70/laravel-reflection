## Laravel Reflection

This project is a SaaS mock app that enables you to create, read, update and delete data from joined tables in a DB. It has custom built authentication, factories and seeders for the joined tables to create data sets, some interactivity programmed with Alpine.JS and a frontend styled with Tailwind.
